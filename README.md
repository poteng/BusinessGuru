# Business Guru

Business Guru is an Android mobile application that will automation systems and resources within the workplace which can provide a more streamline and comfortable working environment. It can track and monitor employees/managers when given their proximity to the work environment through their registered device, which will then automatically control systems related to operations, productivity, security, and employee comfort. 

## Current state (version 1.3.5)
Currently, the working feature is automatically turning on/off connected devices via GPS information, which allows Business Guru to help to prepare/set up the work environment before the user arrive to the work place.

The related applications would be automatically turning on computers/lights/AC... etc. If the door has an eletronic lock and is connected to the device, the auto-unlocking  should also be useful.

The current feature does not include the hardware parts yet.

## Difficulty
The time and techniques we could use were limited due to lack of hardware experts in our three people team, so it was the best we could do.

## Future
The current version is just one part of the whole plan. The project is likely to continue if we have people who want to join.
